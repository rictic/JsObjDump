JSON.stringify(randomObject) sometimes crashes.

JSON.stringify(JsObjDump.annotate(randomObject)) will never crash.

JsObjDump is a library for creating copies of objects suitable for logging and debug displays.  There are a number of options to control what information about the object is included in its copy, and how much information is too much.

Check out the examples under test/ for more information.
